# Madis O.

**Hardware Security Researcher | IoT Developer | Cybersecurity Student**  
**Netherlands**

Building privacy-focused infrastructure, custom surveillance detection systems, and offensive security tools for ethical research. Working under the banner of **NullSec**

---

## 🖧 What I'm Building

### **NullNexus** - Home Server Cluster
Ultra-compact homelab built from decommissioned enterprise hardware. Running Proxmox for VM orchestration, focusing on privacy-first infrastructure and distributed computing research.

### **Active IoT Projects**
- **Project Odradek** *(Death Stranding)* - Automated weather warning system with solenoid-actuated indicators
- **Project Wheatley** *(Portal)* - RF surveillance detection using MAC fingerprinting and pattern analysis
- **Project Cerberus** *(Cyberpunk 2077)* - Network penetration testing toolkit (sanitized public version available)
- **Project BT-7274** *(Titanfall 2)* - Localized AI assistant (tested Mistral 7B, Qwen, comparative LLM optimization)

### **Current Infrastructure**
**Raspberry Pi** - Hardened with Tailscale mesh, custom DNS, full encryption  
Running: AdGuard Home, Nextcloud, Vaultwarden, Uptime Kuma, NetAlertX, and custom NAS

**Jetson Orin Nano** - LLM testing, ESP32 development, model fine-tuning

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Hardware:** Raspberry Pi, Jetson Orin Nano, MacBookPro 2011 (Ubuntu), ESP32, CAN BUS interfacing, RF modules  
**Security:** Tailscale, network segmentation, pentesting tools, MAC fingerprinting  
**IoT:** Custom web interfaces, MQTT, Home Assistant integration  
**AI/ML:** Mistral 7B, Qwen, LLM optimization and local deployment  
**Dev:** Docker, Proxmox, Python, C++, embedded systems  
**Automotive:** OBD-II diagnostics, CAN BUS reverse engineering

---

## 🚗 Side Notes

Car enthusiast and amateur automotive diagnostician. Diagnosed a failing turbocharger on a family vehicle via OBD-II port analysis - saving weeks of troubleshooting. The BT-7274 project started as an attempt to build a car-integrated AI assistant before pivoting to home infrastructure.

## 🎯 NullSec Services

Beyond research, I offer:
- Web development (frontend focus, security-hardened)
- Network security consulting
- Digital privacy setup for individuals and small businesses
- Custom IoT solutions

Student rates, Netherlands-based.
